#### ScrollView vs FlatList

- ScrollView: ScrollView renders all its react child components at once, but this has a performance downside.

- FlatList: FlatList renders items lazily, when they are about to appear, and removes items that scroll way off screen to save memory and processing time.
  FlatList is also handy if you want to render separators between your items, multiple columns, infinite scroll loading, or any number of other features it supports out of the box.
